# Secondary-Structure-Prediction

#### PROGRAM: 

This program 'SSPrediction_kNN.py' uses an attached protein dataset (Dataset.csv) to perform 5-fold cross validation using k-NN with binary feature vectors and classifies the protein into its secondary structure, i.e, into one of the 3 classes (H,E or C).

#### DEPENDENCIES:

Python 3 
Python IDE (Spyder, IDLE, Eclipse)

#### USAGE/EXECUTING PROGRAM:

Run the program from the IDE

#### OUTPUT:
	
Average accuracy of prediction and standard deviation for different values of sliding window (5,7,9,11) and different choices of k-nearest neighbors.
